Requisites: Requests package

This project is called "Tolkien Finder". It is a program that shows the user the most important information about a character from J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy universe, inspired in part by Professor David J. Malan's classroom exercises on J.K. Rowling's characters. The information is presented in a simple interface, accompanied by a picture of the character, if available.
The information of the searched character will be:
    - Name
    - Race
    - Birth
    - Death (Spoiler alert)

In order to display all this information, it is stored in an object that is constructed with a class that I have built myself.

Built the class
Understand API's and authentication process
    - Handle issues with the name search in case of more than one match
Dive in JSON manipulation
Learn data presentation i.e. how to "show" an object
Learn Tkinter for the GUI
